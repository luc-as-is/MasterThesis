Allele specific expression of Host-plant preference in Heliconius butterflies
This is a repository of my master thesis work at Ludwig Maximilian University, which I completed in 2021. I conducted this research in the Speciation Behaviour Lab supervised by Dr. Richard Merrill.
The goal of this project was to identify genes associated with differences in host-plant use in two closely related species of Heliconius butterflies. Any questions can be sent to lucas.anth.asis@gmail.com.
